# Contributing

If you have found yourself here, we assume you are interested in the project and want to help make it better.
There are countless ways of contributing to a project and if you are unsure how to do it, here are some examples.
**Thank you, for taking the time to contribute.**

## How to contribute

## Issue

If you are unhappy with an aspect of the tool, you are welcome to create a new issue and **propose a feature that you would like to see, report a bug that you have found, add tests that ensure correctness, correct spelling mistakes, or whatever else is on your mind**.
This feedback is necessary for us to efficiently allocate our resources and the more precise it is, the easier it will be for us to act.
This is why we encourage you to follow the issue template and provide a ![minimal reproducer (MRE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example) if possible.

## Pull Requests

If you are a step further and you have not only found a problem but have already solved it, feel free to add a Pull Request (PR) with your proposed fix.
In general, we follow the ![Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) repository workflow.

These are the ways of contributing for now. In the future, I would like to add this.

## Benchmarking

Since we also focus on performance we are very interested in how our tool performs on your hardware.
Therefore, we have written a benchmark that you can run on your machine and upload to us.
